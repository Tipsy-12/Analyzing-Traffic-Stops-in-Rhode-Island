# Analyzing-Traffic-Stops-in-Rhode-Island-A-Data-Driven-Look-into-Police-Interactions

**Year:** 2024
**Type:** Data Analysis / Public Policy Project  
**Dataset Source:** Stanford Open Policing Project  
**Notebook:** RHODE_ISLAND_1.ipynb

## Overview

This project analyzes traffic stop data from Rhode Island, covering records from 2013 onward. The data, made available by the Stanford Open Policing Project, provides detailed information on police stops, searches, and outcomes. The goal of this project is to explore patterns in law enforcement behavior and raise data-informed questions about fairness and efficiency in policing.

## Key Questions Explored

- Do men or women speed more often?
- Does gender affect the likelihood of being searched during a stop?
- During a search, how often is the driver frisked?
- Which year had the lowest number of stops?
- How does drug-related activity vary by time of day?
- Are most stops conducted during nighttime?

## Methodology

- Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and standardize formats.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover distributions and patterns.
- Time-based and categorical breakdowns to examine variations in stop behavior.
- Visualizations to support interpretations and highlight key findings.

## Data Source & Acknowledgment

## Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, datetime

## Conclusion

This project highlights how publicly available data can reveal trends in law enforcement practices and serve as a tool for public accountability and policy analysis. It encourages deeper exploration of how factors like gender, time, and search outcomes correlate with traffic stop dynamics in Rhode Island.
